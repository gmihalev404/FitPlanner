about.welcome1=Welcome to FitPlanner — your personal space for building healthier habits, staying motivated, and reaching your\
  \ fitness goals at your own pace. We created FitPlanner for people who want a smarter, more flexible way to plan their\
  \ workouts, whether you're brand-new to training or already deep into your fitness journey.
about.welcome2=With FitPlanner, you’re in control. You can easily create your own workout programs by choosing from a wide\
  \ list of exercises and adjusting sets, reps, rest times, and more. Whether you prefer strength training, cardio, mobility\
  \ work, or a mix of everything, building the perfect routine is simple and intuitive.
about.welcome3=If you’d rather start with something prepared, FitPlanner offers ready-made programs created by experienced\
  \ trainers. You can follow them as they are, or use them as inspiration for your own personalized plan. Both customers and\
  \ trainers can share their programs publicly, creating a growing library of routines for all fitness levels.
about.welcome4=FitPlanner is designed to grow with you. Our smart progression algorithm tracks your training streaks and\
  \ suggests when it's time to increase or decrease intensity, helping you stay challenged without overtraining. Whether\
  \ you're aiming to get stronger, fitter, or simply more consistent, the app adapts to your performance so you can keep\
  \ improving safely. We know that everyone starts somewhere — and everyone progresses differently. That’s why FitPlanner\
  \ includes multiple difficulty levels, ensuring that beginners, intermediates, and advanced athletes all find programs that\
  \ suit their needs.
